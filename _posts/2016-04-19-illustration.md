  As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur
  rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and
  candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs,
  Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy
  Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble
  everything up.
